single-cell RNA-seq meta-analysis Tool
designed to:   

     Integrate heterogeneous datasets from multiple labs/platforms.  
     Identify conserved cell clusters and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across batches.  
     Provide an interactive Streamlit dashboard for parameter tuning and visualization.
     

Built with Scanpy, Harmony, and Streamlit, MetaSC bridges computational complexity and biological insight, enabling reproducible meta-analyses even for non-experts. 
🔍 Key Features 
🧪 Core Analysis Pipeline 

     Batch Correction: Uses Harmony integration to align datasets across technical batches 

.  
 Clustering: Leiden algorithm on UMAP-embedded data ensures robust cell-type identification 
.  
 Conserved DEGs: Identifies genes consistently dysregulated across batches, reducing technical noise 

    .
     

🌐 User-Friendly Interface 

     Streamlit Dashboard:  
         Upload datasets (supports 10X, AnnData, CSV formats) 

.  
 Visualize UMAP plots colored by batch or cluster 
.  
 Adjust parameters (e.g., clustering resolution, gene filters) in real-time 
.  
 Download DEG lists and integrated datasets for further analysis 

        .
         
     

🛠️ Flexibility & Robustness 

     Input Formats: Process CSV, 10X mtx, or preprocessed AnnData objects.  
     Error Handling: Built-in checks for missing files or incompatible data 

    .  
     Reproducibility: Save full analysis workflows with parameter logs.
     

📦 Quick Start 
Installation 
bash

pip install metasc  # Coming soon to PyPI!
# Or from source:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/metascrepo.git
cd metascrepo
pip install -r requirements.txt
 
 
Run the Dashboard 
bash cmd
streamlit run app.py
 
 

Open your browser to http://localhost:8501 and start analyzing! 
📊 Example Workflow 

     Upload Datasets: Drag-and-drop multiple 10X or AnnData files.  
     Configure Parameters:  
         Set min_genes=500 to filter low-quality cells 

.  
 Adjust resolution=0.8 for cluster granularity 

        .
         
     Analyze & Visualize:  
         View batch-corrected UMAP plots.  
         Download DEG lists for conserved cell populations.
